# JQ_Todo

This is a small little project I did in about and hour or so, using some JQuery methods and some HTML and CSS.

- This To-Do List app can hide the input field or show it by      clicking on the plus sign.

- Click on a to do and it will mark a linethrough and chage       color to grey

- You can add or delete a todo.  Use the hover feature to         reveal the trash icon. Click it to delete it.
